# Beeminder Dashboard

A dashboard I built for myself to watch my [Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/) goals.

(Note that this is an "FYI-only" open source project. No guarantees that I'll answer or even read any issues or pull requests. They might be closed without any warning!)

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `bun i` or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
